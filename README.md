# url-ok

`url-ok` is a HTTP and HTTPS status checker for URLs. The default timeout is 120 seconds at
which point it will abort the checks and the process will have an exit code of 1. If all
the checks are successfull (success is defined as returning 200), the process will have an
exit code of 0.

If a URL cannot be reached, it will continue to try to reach the URL every 500 milleseconds
up to the timeout. For HTTP, it uses a HEAD request while for HTTPS it uses GET.
